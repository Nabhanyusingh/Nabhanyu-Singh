        <p>ABOUT THE GROUP

            Sunbeam was founded in 1972 by Dr.Amrit lal ‘Ishrat Madhok and Mrs. Deesh ‘ Ishrat’ Madhok, who felt the need of a private educational institution to cater to the holistic educational needs of the students fraternity in Varanasi and thus was born Sunbeam. Sunbeam started its momentous journey in a small rented apartment. Armed with a vision plus boundless energy and gaining credibility by the day, giant strides were made and the young institution grew rapidly in enrolment, quality and community recognition and soon outgrew its place of birth and it became obvious that a new location was needed.<br><img src="67.jpg"><br>After Sunbeam Bhagwanpur came Sunbeam Schools at Annapurna (1996), Sunbeam Women’s College (2000), Lahartara (2002),Varuna (2002), Indiranagar (2005) and Suncity (2010). The progressive march to spread education also resulted in opening up of Associate Sunbeam Schools at Mughalsarai (2004) Jaunpur, Allahabad, Ghazipur and Mau (all in 2011) and Deoria, Bhadohi and Narayanpur (2012) with many more on the anvil. Today more than 16000 students are part of Sunbeam Schools which over the years have given to the society, citizens par excellence and continue to contribute to the society through innumerable CBSE board toppers, national and international players of repute and stars who are shining bright in the cultural horizon.

            As a group, Sunbeam truly epitomizes the fact that success is a journey and not a destination.</p>
